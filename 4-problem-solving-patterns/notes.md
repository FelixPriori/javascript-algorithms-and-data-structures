## Problem Solving Patterns

Kind of like programing mechanisms, or blueprints.

### 1. Frequency Counter Pattern

Uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. Often involves nested loops or O(n^2) operations with string or arrays.

> _Ex:_ Write afunction called same, which accepts two arrays. The functions should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same.

> _Ex:_ Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.

### 2. Multiple Pointers Pattern

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

> _Ex:_ Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.

> _Ex:_ Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted.

### 3. Sliding Window Pattern

### 4. Divide And Conquer Pattern
