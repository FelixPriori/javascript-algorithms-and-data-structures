## Problem Solving Approach

Reading: _George Polya: How to solve it_

### 1. Understand the problem

Take a step back, and ask yourself some questions:

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

### 2. Explore concrete examples

Coming up with examples can:

- help you understand the problem better
- provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works

ex: user stories, unit tests

Exploring examples:

- Start with simple examples
- Propgress to more complex examples
- explore examples with emtpy inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs

### 3. Break it down

Kind of like _pseudocode_: Explicitly write out the steps that you need to take.

- Forces you to think about the code before writing it
- helps you catch lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings

### 4. Solve / Simplify

Solve the problem. If you can't: solve a simpler problem.
Simplify:

- find core difficulty
- temporarily ignore the difficulty
- write a simplified solution
- incorporate difficulty back in

### 5. Look back and refactor

Ask yourself those questions:

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
